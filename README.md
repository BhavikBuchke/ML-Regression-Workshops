# 📊 Regression Modeling Portfolio: End-to-End Predictive Solutions

### 🚀 Overview

This repository is a curated collection of data science projects focused on solving real-world prediction challenges. Each project follows a systematic engineering lifecycle: translating business requirements into technical architectures, optimizing feature pipelines, and benchmarking multiple regression algorithms to find production-grade solutions.

### 🛠 Core Technical Stack

* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn (Pipelines, ColumnTransformers, Ensemble Methods).
* **Data Engineering:** Pandas, NumPy, Automated Feature Scaling & Imputation.
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn (Correlation Heatmaps, 3D Feature Space).

## 📂 Project Catalog

### 1. 🏠 Residential House Price Prediction

**Problem:** Real estate valuation is often biased by manual appraisal; this project aims to automate price estimation using 30+ physical and geographical variables.

* **Action:** I engineered an automated preprocessing pipeline to handle high-cardinality categorical data and missing values. I then iteratively trained models ranging from **Linear Regression** to **Random Forest Ensembles**.
* **Result:** The **Random Forest Regressor** achieved the highest accuracy. I **gained** a significant reduction in RMSE by utilizing ensemble bagging to stabilize predictions across diverse property types.

### 2. 🏎️ Automotive Market Analysis

**Problem:** Predicting vehicle resale value across varying manufacturers and technical specifications.

* **Action:** Applied **One-Hot Encoding** for categorical features and **Standard Scaling** for numerical inputs within a unified Scikit-Learn Pipeline.
* **Result:** I **gained** a highly portable preprocessing framework that allows the model to process new vehicle data with zero manual feature engineering.

3. **No "Exercise" talk:** It treats the car price section as an "Automotive Market Analysis" rather than just a homework exercise.
